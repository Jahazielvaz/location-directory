DESCRIPTION: This app gives you a list of matching cities, and states based on your input.

REQUIREMENTS
/ Must contain various cities and states to choose from.
/ Must contain an input field, where the user can type
-Must contain a matching feature that matches all the letters and patterns being typed in to all the letters and patterns inside our cities and state
-Must contain some kind of color change for when letters are being matched, like a highlighting feature
-Must contain a dropdown that shows the results
-The dropdown must have the desired styling, which is an alternating skew feature.

MY IDEAS FOR HOW TO COMPLETE THIS PROJECT
1- Find the API that contains the data you need and fetch it, and put it in an array
2- build the css styling with skew or some other feature that allows you to give it the desired style (you may need to use a conditional in order to alternate the skew direction)
3- Use an empty element that can be accessed by js.
4- Map or forEach, or do some kind of iteration to get the element to dynamically be created as data passes through.
5- use the classList feature to be able to dynamically add that class to every result that we get back.




THINGS I'VE LEARNED


THINGS TO PRACTICE/LOOK INTO
- RegExp() constructor - I need to know how to use it, and the logic behind it (Break down the findMatches function, and be able to recreate it at will)
- Regex methods, and patterns.
- Fetch with public apis (Find a way to connect to some higher level apis like twitter, maybe youtube, or fb, etc) Use fetch.
- Ajax calls. Get this handled once and for all.
- forEach() : Find out when to use it and when not to use it, and what's the difference between forEach and the map feature, and when to use each of them.
- Array methods : Find a way to combine and use them with regex to create powerful data manipulation.
- This keyword, specially in the way that this guy knows how to use it. Understand exactly when it targets what, and do a bunch of exercises until you fully know how to use it.
