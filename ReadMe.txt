DESCRIPTION: This app gives you a list of matching cities, and states based on your input.

REQUIREMENTS
/ Must contain various cities and states to choose from.
/ Must contain an input field, where the user can type
-Must contain a matching feature that matches all the letters and patterns being typed in to all the letters and patterns inside our cities and state
-Must contain some kind of color change for when letters are being matched, like a highlighting feature
-Must contain a dropdown that shows the results
-The dropdown must have the desired styling, which is an alternating skew feature.

MY IDEAS FOR HOW TO COMPLETE THIS PROJECT
1- Find the API that contains the data you need and fetch it, and put it in an array
2- build the css styling with skew or some other feature that allows you to give it the desired style (you may need to use a conditional in order to alternate the skew direction)
3- Use an empty element that can be accessed by js.
4- Map or forEach, or do some kind of iteration to get the element to dynamically be created as data passes through.
5- use the classList feature to be able to dynamically add that class to every result that we get back.




THINGS I'VE LEARNED


THINGS TO PRACTICE/LOOK INTO
- RegExp() constructor - I need to know how to use it, and the logic behind it (Break down the findMatches function, and be able to recreate it at will)
- Regex methods, and patterns.
- Fetch with public apis (Find a way to connect to some higher level apis like twitter, maybe youtube, or fb, etc) Use fetch.
- Ajax calls. Get this handled once and for all.
- forEach() : Find out when to use it and when not to use it, and what's the difference between forEach and the map feature, and when to use each of them.
- Array methods : Find a way to combine and use them with regex to create powerful data manipulation.
- This keyword, specially in the way that this guy knows how to use it. Understand exactly when it targets what, and do a bunch of exercises until you fully know how to use it.
- .join(' ') : I don't fully know what this does or what it's used for.
- Find the difference between forEach() and map(). When it's better to use what.
- .replace() : I'm not fully sure how this works, but all I know is that you can replace things with other things. I don't know the rules or anything. This is another concept that I want to learn really well, and to find good uses for.
- Finally, consolidate all the things you need to study from the last app with the things in this one. Go on a discovery phase to find out what kind of things you can build with each of them, and write them down for each of them. Then figure out what kind of app you can build that requires you to use each of the things, and build it.
- I also want to learn geolocation in the near future
