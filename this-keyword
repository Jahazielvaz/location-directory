THIS IS MY PRACTICE ON HOW THE THIS KEYWORD WORKS

FUN FACTS
Default Binding: this is bound to the window object
-The this keyword so far refers to the window items. Or in other words. Where you invoke it doesn't affect it, but rather it searches for the name of the variable of piece of data you have selected, in the window item.
-The this keyword doesn't work when invoking variables that use let, or const as their keyword. I'm not 100% sure but I don't think the this keyword works to invoke functions.
-The this keyword can be invoked anywhere so far, as long as the target of the invocation starts with the var keyword even on es6 syntax functions or let or const variables.
  EXAMPLE:
    var message = "This is a message";


Implicit Binding: this is bound to the object that contains the piece of data being invoked by the this keyword
-First of all, the only example I have of getting implicit binding to work right now, is using it between an object and a function, so that's the example I'll give you right now. Later on we'll see if we can expand on it.
 This one has been particularly confusing so make sure you pay close attention. You first need to add the function as one of the properties of the object (Make sure you do not invoke the function within the object when using it as one of the properties of the object.)
-Then you can refer to any of the other properties that belong to the object within the function, using the this keyword. Then it'll know that you're referring to the property that belongs to the object.
-Finally the result will live as the value of the property that contains the function (Make sure that when you access this property, that you actually invoke the function with the parenthesis)
-This will not work if the function is using new syntax
  EXAMPLE:
    let myObj = {
      message: "Hello World",
      myFunc: myFunc
    }

    function myFunc(){
      return this.message;
    }

    myObj.myFunc() // Will return "Hello World"

Explicit Binding: In this case you actually force a function call to use a particular object for this binding, without putting a property function reference on the object. Or in other words, we explicitly tell the function call what object it should use to bind the this keyword to. We do this by using functions such as call, apply, and bind.
-It's going to return undefined if the function invoking the this keyword is built with es6 syntax, however, the object being invoked by the this keyword, can be built using es6 syntax
  EXAMPLE(Using the call method):
    function myFunc(){
      return this.message
    }

    let myObj = {
      message: "Hello World"
    }

    myFunc.call(myObj) //Will return Hello World
    NOTE: If you had extra arguments on the function, they would be passed normally
    EXAMPLE: myFunc.call(myObj, arg1, arg2)

    NOTE: If you were to use .apply, instead of .call, it seems that it would do the same thing, except you would pass the arguments as an array.
    EXAMPLE: myFunc.apply(myObj, [arg1, arg2])

-The bind function: The bind function creates a new function which binds the old function (The one that's invoking the this keyword), to the desired object. Basically it takes in both the function and the object, and returns the results of the original function, except now because of it the this keyword in the old function now works since they're both bound in the new function.
  EXAMPLE:
    function myFunc(){
      return this.message
    }

    let myObj = {
      message: 'Dragons Exist'
    }

    let hiddenMessage = myFunc.bind(myObj);

    hiddenMessage() // Would return "Dragons Exist"

    NOTE: You can use bind when you want to return a function that you want to execute later, whereas call and apply you can use when you want to execute the function immediately.
